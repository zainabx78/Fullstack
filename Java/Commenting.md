## Commenting (making notes in the code)

- `//` - enables you to make a note on that line. Single line comment. 
- `/*` - Multi-line comment - automatically adds `*/` at the end of the comment. Comment continues til the end `*/`.

```java
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // This is a single line comment
        /*
        This
        Is
        A
        Comment
         */
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}


```
- If you want to comment out a whole block of code, highlight the code and press `CTRL + /` button and the whole block will get commented out.
