# OOP 
- Method overloading --> same method can take multiple different parameters = COMPILE TIME POLYMORPHISM!. 
- Method overriding --> override the inherited method.
- No system output lines in methods!!!!
- Static methods --> can access with class name. method name. 
- Non-static --> have to create an object to use method.


## Constructors

A constructor is a special method with the same name as the class, used to initialize objects.

# Abstraction

- Having a real life object represented by a class.
- Concept of classes.


# Encapsulation
- Data hiding - private member fields which have to be made public to have access to them. 

- Getters and Setters:
  
```java
public String getFirstName() { return firstName; }
public String getLastName() { return lastName; }
public void setLastName(String LastName) { this.lastName = lastName; }
```
- Getters return the private variables.
- Setters (setlastname) allows changing the last name. 

# Inheritance

- Everything is inherited from object class. 
- `IS A` relationship e.g. a human is an ape is a mammal etc. 
- Can only inherit from one class.  
- Use `protected` when creating object in the superclass to use that in the subclass. 
- 
  

# Polymorphism 

- Many forms of something. 
- Method overloading/compile time polymorphism: a method that does one thing but takes different parameters. 
- - Method overloading --> same method can take multiple different parameters = COMPILE TIME POLYMORPHISM!. 
- Interfaces!!
