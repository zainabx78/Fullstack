# PROJECT --> HOW IT ALL COMES TOGETHER: ZOO PROJECT

## Overview:

### App.java:

- The entry point containing main method.
- Creates animals --> Lion. 
- Creates staff --> Zookeeper.
- Adds them to an ArrayList<Speakable> zooThings.
- Loops through them and calls talk() on each. 


### Speakable Interface file:

- An interface that enforces the talk () method.
- Implemented by all animals and staff. 


### Animal class file:

- An abstract class --> means that it's implemented by other derived classes. 
- Implements Speakable interface.
- Provides constructor, getters and setters. 
- Leaves talk () abstracted so each animal can implement it differently. 


### Lion subclass file:

- Extends from the Animal file. 
- Provides implementation of talk () e.g. the string the lion will contain. 

### Staff class file:

- Includes fields --> name, dateofEmployment etc.
- Implements Speakable --> default intro speech.


### Zookeeper subclass file:
- Extends from the staff file. 
- Methods --> feedanimals, cleanenclosure etc. 
- Overrides the talk () interface. 


## **ðŸ”„ How It All Works Together**
Speakable defines a common contract â†’ everyone must talk().

Animal hierarchy â†’ different animals have different ways of talking.

Staff hierarchy â†’ staff also talk(), but with human messages.

Zookeeper has special methods tied to their role (feeding, cleaning, etc.).

App brings them together into one collection (ArrayList<Speakable>) and runs the zoo simulation.

Tests ensure each class behaves correctly.

## **âœ… Summary:**

App.java â†’ Runs everything.

Speakable â†’ Interface (forces talk() on all).

Animal.java â†’ Abstract parent for animals.

Lion/Zebra â†’ Example concrete animals.

Staff.java â†’ Parent for staff roles.

Zookeeper.java â†’ Specialized staff with zoo-related tasks.

Tests â†’ Ensure correctness of methods.



OUTPUT = A zoo with animals , with staff.
